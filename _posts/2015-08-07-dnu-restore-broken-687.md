I have recently updated to the latest ASP.NET 5 Beta on my OS X development machines. One of the first stumbling blocks that I ran into was issue [#687: dnu restore broken](https://github.com/aspnet/Home/issues/687).

**Figure: Permission is denied.**

This is a minor issue, and the fix is relatively simple

**Steps to fix:**

1. Open Terminal `âŒ˜+space Terminal`
2. Execute the following: 

````bash    
    cd ~/.dnx/runtimes/dnx-mono.1.0.0-beta6/bin/
    chmod +x dnu
````
No more issues.
