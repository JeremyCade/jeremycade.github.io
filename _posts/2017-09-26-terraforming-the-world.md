Back in August 2018, I was fortunate enough to side-load a last minute talk into [NDC Sydney](https://ndcsydney.com/speaker/jeremy-cade/) on using HashiCorp's [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) to stand up infrastructure.

This particular talk was prepared in the space of about 2 hours. While it's not the best presentation I've ever put together, I'm reasonably happy with how it turned out.
