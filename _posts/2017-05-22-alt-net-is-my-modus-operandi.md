I write software with C# in a Text Editor on Mac OS. No Visual Studio.

The software I build is small, modular and self-contained. No monoliths.

All SCM is via the command line, using the tools the way they were designed.

Continuous Integration runs on Windows Server and Ubuntu, and the builds are well defined in code, that is checked in with the repository. No XML in sight.

Deployment targets (Windows Server, Ubuntu, Docker Containers, App Service) are defined and managed with code.

ALMOST everything I use is Open Source (to varying degrees).

## How the times have changed

It's been 10 years since the ALT.NET phrase was coined.

In 2007 .NET as a whole was a very different beast. .NET 3.5 shipped with Visual Studio 2008 in November, followed by ASP.NET MVC CTP in December.

Though most of us where still drudging through VB.NET & C# .NET 1.1 and .NET 2.0 code bases. Visual Studio 2005, need a number of service backs before it was useful. Web Forms and Windows Forms were the bane of my existence.

Windows Vista or Windows XP were the operating Systems of choice.

At the time, there were a lot of discussions around technology choice; e.g. You are an ALT.NET practitioner if you used Resharper (or CodeRush), or NHibernate, or a RDBMS that wasn't SQL Server.

Though for me it was always more about choice.

- What choices did I have to build the best software?
- What choices did I have in terms of Development Environment's?
- What choices did I have in terms of Architectural Patterns?
- How could I build better software?

To me that was the ALT.NET Mindset. I really wanted to have choice.

Moving forward to 2017:  The .NET Community has matured. Microsoft as an organisation has quite drastically changed. The .NET Core SDK and Runtimes have moved to the point where I no longer need Windows & Visual Studio to build fast, robust applications with C#.

Granted you could always write C# in a text editor, and push it through csc.exe or MSBuild. But it always felt clunky.

Oh, how the times of changed, and you know what? It feels great!

## Hands Down

Microsoft's decision to make .NET Core cross-platform has been the single largest change, and the single largest productivity gain that I have had from the .NET Eco-System in 15 years.

Not only does it enable me to work the way that I want to work, use the tools that I want to use, but it has allowed me to build fast scalable systems with less code at a much lower cost.

As far as my version of ALT.NET is concerned.

I'm there. I have choices, and that's a win in my book.
