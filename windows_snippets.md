A collection of Snippets, commands and other useful things for Windows that I often forget, and need to lookup. 

### Powershell

### Reload your profile.

    . $Profile

### Windows Environment Commands

- %USERPROFILE% - Equivalent of ~ on *nix systems. 
- %WINDIR% - Windows Directory

### .Directories and .Files

To create .Directories in File Explorer append a "."" to the directory name. e.g.

    .foldername.

To create .Directories in Command Prompt or Powershell:

    mkdir .Directory

To create .Files in File Explorer append a "." to the file name; e.g.

    .filename.
