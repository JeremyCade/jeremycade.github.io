After more then 13 years, I have made the decision to leave my Software Engineering role with [Monte Huebsch](http://www.montehuebsch.com) and team at [AussieWeb](http://www.aussieweb.com.au) and take on a Senior Software Architect position with [Adam Cogan](http://www.adamcogan.com/) and his team at [SSW](http://www.ssw.com.au).

### Goodbye AussieWeb
AussieWeb has been my home for more then a decade. When I started, AussieWeb was a small business, with only 4 permanent part-time employees, .Net was still in it's early releases (1.0 and 1.1), and the main business was Website Development & Hosting provider. Today AussieWeb employees 10 full time staff on a generous salary & benefits package. The business itself has transformed from a Website Development & Hosting provider to one of the leading Google AdWords Partners in Google's Asia-Pacific Region. 

My time at AussieWeb has allowed me to do things that I would never have been able to do if I had taken the normal corporate developer route. I was able to live in different cities and countries and work remotely in during a time when "remote" workers were a new idea. I had complete flexibility as to when and where I worked. The technology stack, platform 

I never wanted for anything during my time at AussieWeb. Be that software, hardware or caffeine. 

Though ultimately I no longer felt like I was being challenged in terms of the types of software and services I was developing. Yes; I was solving real problems. Yes; I was delivering quantifiable value. But I didn't feel challenged. 

### Hello SSW
I have already started with SSW in a part-time capacity.
